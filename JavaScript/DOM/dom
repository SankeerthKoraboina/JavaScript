/*
Window --> document --> Html Elements

tree structure , each is an object


html and css are static in nature.
For instance,to change the theme (dark mode , light mode) the css files cannot be modified
So,it is done dynamically at runtime through javascript using dom

Dynamic Changes are done with js and cannot be donw with html,css
Dynamic Changes or manipulation include changing content,background,etc


Go to console --> type window --> document >> and edit

ex--> document.body.style.backgroundcolor="green"
